## Getting Started

### Building from Source (Recommended)

For security and transparency, we recommend building the launcher from source code:

1. **Follow the [Build Instructions](BUILD.md)** to compile the application yourself
2. Run the built executable from `bin/Release/net9.0-windows7.0/`
3. Launch and play!

**Why build from source?**
- ✅ Full transparency - inspect all code before running
- ✅ Verify security yourself - no need to trust pre-built binaries
- ✅ Customizable - modify the code to suit your needs
- ✅ No malware risk - you control what gets compiled

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.
